# Milestone 1

# EduPro – Plataforma de Gestão de Exames e Conteúdos Formativos


## 1. Background

Educational and professional training institutions require tools that integrate the creation, management, and evaluation of pedagogical content. Currently, exam preparation, UFCD (Short-Duration Training Unit) planning, and manual production are carried out in dispersed systems with heavy reliance on manual processes.
 
This results in inefficiencies, work duplication, and failures in documentation standardization.
EduPro aims to address these gaps by offering an integrated solution for teachers and coordinators, from creating exams with automatic grading to planning and standardizing pedagogical content. The platform seeks to transform fragmented traditional processes into a unified, efficient, and scalable experience
